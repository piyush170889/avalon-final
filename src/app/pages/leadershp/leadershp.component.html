               <p class="mb-0 text-justify">The legacy of Hiroji Indulkar was carried on by his descendant Anil Indulkar. Pioneering architect Hiroji Indulkar was the great grandfather of Anil Indulkar. He studied in St. Josephs, Kohlapur and moved abroad to study at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1979. Back then, his entire family had a tradition of studying abroad. Anil wanted to carry on the tradition of the family and followed their footsteps. He established the Avalon Pharmacy in 1987 which offers convenient and fast patient care and medication to make the lives of the ailing masses easier. The business received an overwhelming response in US real estate that enabled Indulkar to develop a better understanding and experience. The pharmacy has completed a journey of thirty five years and continues to run successfully even today. In 1994, Anil Indulkar wanted to come back to his roots in Kohlapur where he spent the golden years of his childhood. The experience he had gathered abroad enabled him to cater to the Indian market in years to come. Pune was perhaps the closest link to his long lost roots in Kohlapur. His spectacular journey started with real estate, land trading and acquisitions in Pune in1994. The years spent abroad had helped him to realize the immense potential of the entertainment industry.
